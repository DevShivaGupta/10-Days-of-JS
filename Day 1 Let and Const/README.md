#### Objective

In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

#### Task

Declare a constant variable,**PI**, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
Read a number,**r**, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
Use **PI** and **r** to calculate the **area** and **perimeter** of a circle having radius **r**.
Print **area** as the first line of output and print **perimeter** as the second line of output.
#### Input Format

A single integer,**r**, denoting the radius of a circle.

#### Constraints
* 0 < r <= 100
* **r** is a floating-point number scaled to at most  decimal places.
#### Output Format

Print the following two lines:

1. On the first line, print the **area** of the circle having radius .
2. On the second line, print the **perimeter** of the circle having radius .
#### Sample Input 0

	2.6
#### Sample Output 0

	21.237166338267002
	16.336281798666924
#### Explanation 0

Given the radius **r=2.6**, we calculate the following:
* **area = π.r<sup>2</sup> = 21.237166338267002**
* perimeter = 2 π r = 16.336281798666924

We then print  as our first line of output and  as our second line of output.
