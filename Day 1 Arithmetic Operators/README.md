### Day 1: Arithmetic Operators
#### Objective

In this challenge, we practice using arithmetic operators. Check out the attached tutorial for resources.

#### Task

Complete the following functions in the editor below:
1. getArea(length, width): Calculate and return the area of a rectangle having sides **length** and **width**.
2. getPerimeter(length, width): Calculate and return the perimeter of a rectangle having sides **length** and **width**.
The values returned by these functions are printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.

#### Explanation 0

The area of the rectangle is **length X Width=3 X 4.5 = 13.5**.<br/>
The perimeter of the rectangle is <br/>
**2.(length + width) = 2.(3+4.5) = 15.**
